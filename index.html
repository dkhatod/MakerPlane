            This plane was designed during the Patriot Hacks Hackathon. In which our team, MPRD, won 2nd place in Most Likely to Be a Startup. After finishing the design for this drone, we realized the flaws in this plane's design. It needed to rely less on 3D printing. <br><a href="https://devpost.com/software/multipurpose-research-drone"> <h4 style="margin-top:.6rem">Read more.</h4></a>

                Our second iteration of the plane involved a more convenient design for flight through the use of lightweight styrofoam. This also made assembly much faster because no extra 3D prints were needed. The last design change was using fiberglass rods to reinforce the frame. <br><a href="https://devpost.com/software/lockheed-martini"> <h4 style="margin-top:.6rem">Read more.</h4></a>

<h3>Maker Plane Kit</h3>
<h4>The Maker Plane Kit will be an open source kit that builds Engineering and Maker skills along side a working Remote Controlled Drone. There are three stages: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. All stages are included in the kit, but anyone can choose which stage in their Maker-Journey they are in. This means that no matter how technically inclined you are, anyone can make this drone themselves and learn key engineering concepts on the way. We plan to extend this concept to other projects, such as affordable kits for mechanical hands or remote-controlled cars.</h4>

    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <!--<h3>We are a team of George Mason University students who are highly motivated and have a very diverse grouping of skills. Our majors are Electrical Engineering, Cybersecurity Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering. We first met as a group as freshmen in the same dorm, but eventually two of us were on the same Hackathon team where we came up with the Maker Plane and won 2nd place in "Most Likely to become a Startup". Later, the four of us got together for another Hackathon and we won 1st place Overall and 2nd place for "Most likely to become a startup" again. What we lack in experience we make up for in motivation and creativity. We will stop at nothing to show people what they are capable of.</h3>-->
    <h3>We are a freshman team from George Mason University, each bringing a unique blend of skills to the table â€” Electrical Engineering, Cybersecurity, Computer Science, and Bioengineering.

        Our story began in the freshman dorms, where we began competing in hackathons together, and as we started to compete and win in more hackathons we realized there's a severe lack of physical hacks. We've then decided to come together to teach others about engineering, and guide our peers to building something cool, together.
        
        At MakerPlane, we're on a mission to revolutionize engineering and inspire others to push their limits.</h3>
